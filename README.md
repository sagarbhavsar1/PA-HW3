# Predictive Analytics Homework 3: Feature Selection and Data Classification

This project focuses on predicting breast cancer survivability using the SEER Public-Use Data. It involves feature selection, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and model evaluation.

## Project Overview

The main objectives of this assignment are:
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the dataset by handling missing values, outlier capping, and standardization.
- **Feature Selection**: Using correlation-based selection to reduce redundancy.
- **Modeling**: Training various classification models, including KNN (from scratch), Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Optimizing parameters for Random Forest and Gradient Boosting.
- **Evaluation**: Analyzing model performance and identifying the top features influencing survivability.

## Key Findings

- **Top Features**: Age, Regional Node Positive, and Tumor Size (excluding Survival Months).
- **Best Model**: Tuned Gradient Boosting achieved the best results across all metrics.

## Recommendations

1. **Age and Screening**: Tailor support for older patients and emphasize early screenings.
2. **Lymph Node Monitoring**: Regularly check lymph nodes to catch cancer spread early.
3. **Early Detection**: Encourage routine screenings, especially for high-risk groups.
